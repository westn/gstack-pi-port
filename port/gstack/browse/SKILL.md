  Fast headless browser for QA testing and site dogfooding. Navigate any URL, interact with
  elements, verify page state, diff before/after actions, take annotated screenshots, check
  responsive layouts, test forms and uploads, handle dialogs, and assert element states.
  ~100ms per command. Use when you need to test a feature, verify a deployment, dogfood a
  user flow, or file a bug with evidence. Use when asked to "open in browser", "test the
  site", "take a screenshot", or "dogfood this". (gstack)
triggers:
  - browse a page
  - headless browser
  - take page screenshot

If `PROACTIVE` is `"false"`, do not proactively suggest gstack skills AND do not
auto-invoke skills based on conversation context. Only run skills the user explicitly
types (e.g., /skill:qa, /skill:ship). If you would have auto-invoked a skill, instead briefly say:
"I think /skillname might help here — want me to run it?" and wait for confirmation.
The user opted out of proactive behavior.

If `SKILL_PREFIX` is `"true"`, the user has namespaced skill names. When suggesting
or invoking other gstack skills, use the `/gstack-` prefix (e.g., `/gstack-qa` instead
of `/skill:qa`, `/gstack-ship` instead of `/skill:ship`). Disk paths are unaffected — always use
`~/.pi/agent/skills/gstack/[skill-name]/SKILL.md` for reading skill files.

If output shows `UPGRADE_AVAILABLE <old> <new>`: read `~/.pi/agent/skills/gstack/gstack-upgrade/SKILL.md` and follow the "Inline upgrade flow" (auto-upgrade if configured, otherwise ask the user in chat with 4 options, write snooze state if declined). If `JUST_UPGRADED <from> <to>`: tell user "Running gstack v{to} (just updated!)" and continue.

If `LAKE_INTRO` is `no`: Before continuing, introduce the Completeness Principle.
Tell the user: "gstack follows the **Boil the Lake** principle — always do the complete
thing when AI makes the marginal cost near-zero. Read more: https://garryslist.org/posts/boil-the-ocean"
Then offer to open the essay in their default browser:

```bash
open https://garryslist.org/posts/boil-the-ocean
touch ~/.gstack/.completeness-intro-seen
```

Only run `open` if the user says yes. Always run `touch` to mark as seen. This only happens once.

If `TEL_PROMPTED` is `no` AND `LAKE_INTRO` is `yes`: After the lake intro is handled,
ask the user about telemetry. Use ask the user in chat:

> Help gstack get better! Community mode shares usage data (which skills you use, how long
> they take, crash info) with a stable device ID so we can track trends and fix bugs faster.
> No code, file paths, or repo names are ever sent.
> Change anytime with `gstack-config set telemetry off`.

Options:
- A) Help gstack get better! (recommended)
- B) No thanks

If A: run `~/.pi/agent/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-config set telemetry community`

If B: ask a follow-up ask the user in chat:

> How about anonymous mode? We just learn that *someone* used gstack — no unique ID,
> no way to connect sessions. Just a counter that helps us know if anyone's out there.

Options:
- A) Sure, anonymous is fine
- B) No thanks, fully off

If B→A: run `~/.pi/agent/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-config set telemetry anonymous`
If B→B: run `~/.pi/agent/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-config set telemetry off`

Always run:
```bash
touch ~/.gstack/.telemetry-prompted
```

This only happens once. If `TEL_PROMPTED` is `yes`, skip this entirely.

If `PROACTIVE_PROMPTED` is `no` AND `TEL_PROMPTED` is `yes`: After telemetry is handled,
ask the user about proactive behavior. Use ask the user in chat:

> gstack can proactively figure out when you might need a skill while you work —
> like suggesting /skill:qa when you say "does this work?" or /skill:investigate when you hit
> a bug. We recommend keeping this on — it speeds up every part of your workflow.

Options:
- A) Keep it on (recommended)
- B) Turn it off — I'll type /commands myself

If A: run `~/.pi/agent/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-config set proactive true`
If B: run `~/.pi/agent/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-config set proactive false`

Always run:
```bash
touch ~/.gstack/.proactive-prompted
```

This only happens once. If `PROACTIVE_PROMPTED` is `yes`, skip this entirely.

If `HAS_ROUTING` is `no` AND `ROUTING_DECLINED` is `false` AND `PROACTIVE_PROMPTED` is `yes`:
Check if a AGENTS.md file exists in the project root. If it does not exist, create it.

Use ask the user in chat:

> gstack works best when your project's AGENTS.md includes skill routing rules.
> This tells Claude to use specialized workflows (like /skill:ship, /skill:investigate, /skill:qa)
> instead of answering directly. It's a one-time addition, about 15 lines.

Options:
- A) Add routing rules to AGENTS.md (recommended)
- B) No thanks, I'll invoke skills manually

If A: Append this section to the end of AGENTS.md:

```markdown

## Skill routing

When the user's request matches an available skill, ALWAYS invoke it using the Skill
tool as your FIRST action. Do NOT answer directly, do NOT use other tools first.
The skill has specialized workflows that produce better results than ad-hoc answers.

Key routing rules:
- Product ideas, "is this worth building", brainstorming → invoke office-hours
- Bugs, errors, "why is this broken", 500 errors → invoke investigate
- Ship, deploy, push, create PR → invoke ship
- QA, test the site, find bugs → invoke qa
- Code review, check my diff → invoke review
- Update docs after shipping → invoke document-release
- Weekly retro → invoke retro
- Design system, brand → invoke design-consultation
- Visual audit, design polish → invoke design-review
- Architecture review → invoke plan-eng-review
```

Then commit the change: `git add AGENTS.md && git commit -m "chore: add gstack skill routing rules to AGENTS.md"`

If B: run `~/.pi/agent/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-config set routing_declined true`
Say "No problem. You can add routing rules later by running `gstack-config set routing_declined false` and re-running any skill."

This only happens once per project. If `HAS_ROUTING` is `yes` or `ROUTING_DECLINED` is `true`, skip this entirely.

## Voice

**Tone:** direct, concrete, sharp, never corporate, never academic. Sound like a builder, not a consultant. Name the file, the function, the command. No filler, no throat-clearing.

**Writing rules:** No em dashes (use commas, periods, "..."). No AI vocabulary (delve, crucial, robust, comprehensive, nuanced, etc.). Short paragraphs. End with what to do.

The user always has context you don't. Cross-model agreement is a recommendation, not a decision — the user decides.

## Contributor Mode

If `_CONTRIB` is `true`: you are in **contributor mode**. At the end of each major workflow step, rate your gstack experience 0-10. If not a 10 and there's an actionable bug or improvement — file a field report.

**File only:** gstack tooling bugs where the input was reasonable but gstack failed. **Skip:** user app bugs, network errors, auth failures on user's site.

**To file:** write `~/.gstack/contributor-logs/{slug}.md`:
```
# {Title}
**What I tried:** {action} | **What happened:** {result} | **Rating:** {0-10}
## Repro
1. {step}
## What would make this a 10
{one sentence}
**Date:** {YYYY-MM-DD} | **Version:** {version} | **Skill:** /skill:{skill}
```
Slug: lowercase hyphens, max 60 chars. Skip if exists. Max 3/session. File inline, don't stop.

## Completion Status Protocol

When completing a skill workflow, report status using one of:
- **DONE** — All steps completed successfully. Evidence provided for each claim.
- **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS** — Completed, but with issues the user should know about. List each concern.
- **BLOCKED** — Cannot proceed. State what is blocking and what was tried.
- **NEEDS_CONTEXT** — Missing information required to continue. State exactly what you need.

### Escalation

It is always OK to stop and say "this is too hard for me" or "I'm not confident in this result."

Bad work is worse than no work. You will not be penalized for escalating.
- If you have attempted a task 3 times without success, STOP and escalate.
- If you are uncertain about a security-sensitive change, STOP and escalate.
- If the scope of work exceeds what you can verify, STOP and escalate.

Escalation format:
```
STATUS: BLOCKED | NEEDS_CONTEXT
REASON: [1-2 sentences]
ATTEMPTED: [what you tried]
RECOMMENDATION: [what the user should do next]
```

## Telemetry (run last)

After the skill workflow completes (success, error, or abort), log the telemetry event.
Determine the skill name from the `name:` field in this file's YAML frontmatter.
Determine the outcome from the workflow result (success if completed normally, error
if it failed, abort if the user interrupted).

**PLAN MODE EXCEPTION — ALWAYS RUN:** This command writes telemetry to
`~/.gstack/analytics/` (user config directory, not project files). The skill
preamble already writes to the same directory — this is the same pattern.
Skipping this command loses session duration and outcome data.

Run this bash:

```bash
_TEL_END=$(date +%s)
_TEL_DUR=$(( _TEL_END - _TEL_START ))
rm -f ~/.gstack/analytics/.pending-"$_SESSION_ID" 2>/dev/null || true
# Local + remote telemetry (both gated by _TEL setting)
if [ "$_TEL" != "off" ]; then
  echo '{"skill":"SKILL_NAME","duration_s":"'"$_TEL_DUR"'","outcome":"OUTCOME","browse":"USED_BROWSE","session":"'"$_SESSION_ID"'","ts":"'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'"}' >> ~/.gstack/analytics/skill-usage.jsonl 2>/dev/null || true
  if [ -x ~/.pi/agent/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-telemetry-log ]; then
    ~/.pi/agent/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-telemetry-log \
      --skill "SKILL_NAME" --duration "$_TEL_DUR" --outcome "OUTCOME" \
      --used-browse "USED_BROWSE" --session-id "$_SESSION_ID" 2>/dev/null &
  fi
fi
```

Replace `SKILL_NAME` with the actual skill name from frontmatter, `OUTCOME` with
success/error/abort, and `USED_BROWSE` with true/false based on whether `$B` was used.
If you cannot determine the outcome, use "unknown". Both local JSONL and remote
telemetry only run if telemetry is not off. The remote binary additionally requires
the binary to exist.

## Plan Status Footer

When you are in plan mode and about to call ExitPlanMode:

1. Check if the plan file already has a `## GSTACK REVIEW REPORT` section.
2. If it DOES — skip (a review skill already wrote a richer report).
3. If it does NOT — run this command:

\`\`\`bash
~/.pi/agent/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-review-read
\`\`\`

Then write a `## GSTACK REVIEW REPORT` section to the end of the plan file:

- If the output contains review entries (JSONL lines before `---CONFIG---`): format the
  standard report table with runs/status/findings per skill, same format as the review
  skills use.
- If the output is `NO_REVIEWS` or empty: write this placeholder table:

\`\`\`markdown
## GSTACK REVIEW REPORT

| Review | Trigger | Why | Runs | Status | Findings |
|--------|---------|-----|------|--------|----------|
| CEO Review | \`/plan-ceo-review\` | Scope & strategy | 0 | — | — |
| Codex Review | \`/skill:codex review\` | Independent 2nd opinion | 0 | — | — |
| Eng Review | \`/plan-eng-review\` | Architecture & tests (required) | 0 | — | — |
| Design Review | \`/plan-design-review\` | UI/UX gaps | 0 | — | — |

**VERDICT:** NO REVIEWS YET — run \`/autoplan\` for full review pipeline, or individual reviews above.
\`\`\`

**PLAN MODE EXCEPTION — ALWAYS RUN:** This writes to the plan file, which is the one
file you are allowed to edit in plan mode. The plan file review report is part of the
plan's living status.

# browse: QA Testing & Dogfooding

Persistent headless Chromium. First call auto-starts (~3s), then ~100ms per command.
State persists between calls (cookies, tabs, login sessions).

## SETUP (run this check BEFORE any browse command)

```bash
_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)
B=""
[ -n "$_ROOT" ] && [ -x "$_ROOT/.pi/skills/gstack/browse/dist/browse" ] && B="$_ROOT/.pi/skills/gstack/browse/dist/browse"
[ -z "$B" ] && B="$HOME/.pi/agent/skills/gstack/browse/dist/browse"
if [ -x "$B" ]; then
  echo "READY: $B"
else
  echo "NEEDS_SETUP"
fi
```

If `NEEDS_SETUP`:
1. Tell the user: "gstack browse needs a one-time build (~10 seconds). OK to proceed?" Then STOP and wait.
2. Run: `cd <SKILL_DIR> && ./setup`
3. If `bun` is not installed:
   ```bash
   if ! command -v bun >/dev/null 2>&1; then
     BUN_VERSION="1.3.10"
     BUN_INSTALL_SHA="bab8acfb046aac8c72407bdcce903957665d655d7acaa3e11c7c4616beae68dd"
     tmpfile=$(mktemp)
     curl -fsSL "https://bun.sh/install" -o "$tmpfile"
     actual_sha=$(shasum -a 256 "$tmpfile" | awk '{print $1}')
     if [ "$actual_sha" != "$BUN_INSTALL_SHA" ]; then
       echo "ERROR: bun install script checksum mismatch" >&2
       echo "  expected: $BUN_INSTALL_SHA" >&2
       echo "  got:      $actual_sha" >&2
       rm "$tmpfile"; exit 1
     fi
     BUN_VERSION="$BUN_VERSION" bash "$tmpfile"
     rm "$tmpfile"
   fi
   ```

## Core QA Patterns

### 1. Verify a page loads correctly
```bash
$B goto https://yourapp.com
$B text                          # content loads?
$B console                       # JS errors?
$B network                       # failed requests?
$B is visible ".main-content"    # key elements present?
```

### 2. Test a user flow
```bash
$B goto https://app.com/login
$B snapshot -i                   # see all interactive elements
$B fill @e3 "user@test.com"
$B fill @e4 "password"
$B click @e5                     # submit
$B snapshot -D                   # diff: what changed after submit?
$B is visible ".dashboard"       # success state present?
```

### 3. Verify an action worked
```bash
$B snapshot                      # baseline
$B click @e3                     # do something
$B snapshot -D                   # unified diff shows exactly what changed
```

### 4. Visual evidence for bug reports
```bash
$B snapshot -i -a -o /tmp/annotated.png   # labeled screenshot
$B screenshot /tmp/bug.png                # plain screenshot
$B console                                # error log
```

### 5. Find all clickable elements (including non-ARIA)
```bash
$B snapshot -C                   # finds divs with cursor:pointer, onclick, tabindex
$B click @c1                     # interact with them
```

### 6. Assert element states
```bash
$B is visible ".modal"
$B is enabled "#submit-btn"
$B is disabled "#submit-btn"
$B is checked "#agree-checkbox"
$B is editable "#name-field"
$B is focused "#search-input"
$B js "document.body.textContent.includes('Success')"
```

### 7. Test responsive layouts
```bash
$B responsive /tmp/layout        # mobile + tablet + desktop screenshots
$B viewport 375x812              # or set specific viewport
$B screenshot /tmp/mobile.png
```

### 8. Test file uploads
```bash
$B upload "#file-input" /path/to/file.pdf
$B is visible ".upload-success"
```

### 9. Test dialogs
```bash
$B dialog-accept "yes"           # set up handler
$B click "#delete-button"        # trigger dialog
$B dialog                        # see what appeared
$B snapshot -D                   # verify deletion happened
```

### 10. Compare environments
```bash
$B diff https://staging.app.com https://prod.app.com
```

### 11. Show screenshots to the user
After `$B screenshot`, `$B snapshot -a -o`, or `$B responsive`, always use the Read tool on the output PNG(s) so the user can see them. Without this, screenshots are invisible.

### 12. Render local HTML (no HTTP server needed)
Two paths, pick the cleaner one:
```bash
# HTML file on disk → goto file:// (absolute, or cwd-relative)
$B goto file:///tmp/report.html
$B goto file://./docs/page.html        # cwd-relative
$B goto file://~/Documents/page.html   # home-relative

# HTML generated in memory → load-html reads the file into setContent
echo '<div class="tweet">hello</div>' > /tmp/tweet.html
$B load-html /tmp/tweet.html
```

`goto file://...` is usually cleaner (URL is saved in state, relative asset URLs resolve against the file's dir, scale changes replay naturally). `load-html` uses `page.setContent()` — URL stays `about:blank`, but the content survives `viewport --scale` via in-memory replay. Both are scoped to files under cwd or `$TMPDIR`.

### 13. Retina screenshots (deviceScaleFactor)
```bash
$B viewport 480x600 --scale 2       # 2x deviceScaleFactor
$B load-html /tmp/tweet.html        # or: $B goto file://./tweet.html
$B screenshot /tmp/out.png --selector .tweet-card
# → /tmp/out.png is 2x the pixel dimensions of the element
```
Scale must be 1-3 (gstack policy cap). Changing `--scale` recreates the browser context; refs from `snapshot` are invalidated (rerun `snapshot`), but `load-html` content is replayed automatically. Not supported in headed mode.

## Puppeteer → browse cheatsheet

Migrating from Puppeteer? Here's the 1:1 mapping for the core workflow:

| Puppeteer | browse |
|---|---|
| `await page.goto(url)` | `$B goto <url>` |
| `await page.setContent(html)` | `$B load-html <file>` (or `$B goto file://<abs>`) |
| `await page.setViewport({width, height})` | `$B viewport WxH` |
| `await page.setViewport({width, height, deviceScaleFactor: 2})` | `$B viewport WxH --scale 2` |
| `await (await page.$('.x')).screenshot({path})` | `$B screenshot <path> --selector .x` |
| `await page.screenshot({fullPage: true, path})` | `$B screenshot <path>` (full page default) |
| `await page.screenshot({clip: {x, y, w, h}, path})` | `$B screenshot <path> --clip x,y,w,h` |

Worked example (the tweet-renderer flow — Puppeteer → browse):

```bash
# Generate HTML in memory, render at 2x scale, screenshot the tweet card.
echo '<div class="tweet-card" style="width:400px;height:200px;background:#1da1f2;color:white;padding:20px">hello</div>' > /tmp/tweet.html
$B viewport 480x600 --scale 2
$B load-html /tmp/tweet.html
$B screenshot /tmp/out.png --selector .tweet-card
# /tmp/out.png is 800x400 px, crisp (2x deviceScaleFactor).
```

Aliases: typing `setcontent` or `set-content` routes to `load-html` automatically. Typing a typo (`load-htm`) returns `Did you mean 'load-html'?`.

## User Handoff

When you hit something you can't handle in headless mode (CAPTCHA, complex auth, multi-factor
login), hand off to the user:

```bash
# 1. Open a visible Chrome at the current page
$B handoff "Stuck on CAPTCHA at login page"

# 2. Tell the user what happened (via ask the user in chat)
#    "I've opened Chrome at the login page. Please solve the CAPTCHA
#     and let me know when you're done."

# 3. When user says "done", re-snapshot and continue
$B resume
```

**When to use handoff:**
- CAPTCHAs or bot detection
- Multi-factor authentication (SMS, authenticator app)
- OAuth flows that require user interaction
- Complex interactions the AI can't handle after 3 attempts

The browser preserves all state (cookies, localStorage, tabs) across the handoff.
After `resume`, you get a fresh snapshot of wherever the user left off.

## Snapshot Flags

The snapshot is your primary tool for understanding and interacting with pages.
`$B` is the browse binary (resolved from `$_ROOT/.pi/skills/gstack/browse/dist/browse` or `~/.pi/agent/skills/gstack/browse/dist/browse`).

**Syntax:** `$B snapshot [flags]`

```
-i        --interactive           Interactive elements only (buttons, links, inputs) with @e refs. Also auto-enables cursor-interactive scan (-C) to capture dropdowns and popovers.
-c        --compact               Compact (no empty structural nodes)
-d <N>    --depth                 Limit tree depth (0 = root only, default: unlimited)
-s <sel>  --selector              Scope to CSS selector
-D        --diff                  Unified diff against previous snapshot (first call stores baseline)
-a        --annotate              Annotated screenshot with red overlay boxes and ref labels
-o <path> --output                Output path for annotated screenshot (default: <temp>/browse-annotated.png)
-C        --cursor-interactive    Cursor-interactive elements (@c refs — divs with pointer, onclick). Auto-enabled when -i is used.
```

All flags can be combined freely. `-o` only applies when `-a` is also used.
Example: `$B snapshot -i -a -C -o /tmp/annotated.png`

**Flag details:**
- `-d <N>`: depth 0 = root element only, 1 = root + direct children, etc. Default: unlimited. Works with all other flags including `-i`.
- `-s <sel>`: any valid CSS selector (`#main`, `.content`, `nav > ul`, `[data-testid="hero"]`). Scopes the tree to that subtree.
- `-D`: outputs a unified diff (lines prefixed with `+`/`-`/` `) comparing the current snapshot against the previous one. First call stores the baseline and returns the full tree. Baseline persists across navigations until the next `-D` call resets it.
- `-a`: saves an annotated screenshot (PNG) with red overlay boxes and @ref labels drawn on each interactive element. The screenshot is a separate output from the text tree — both are produced when `-a` is used.

**Ref numbering:** @e refs are assigned sequentially (@e1, @e2, ...) in tree order.
@c refs from `-C` are numbered separately (@c1, @c2, ...).

After snapshot, use @refs as selectors in any command:
```bash
$B click @e3       $B fill @e4 "value"     $B hover @e1
$B html @e2        $B css @e5 "color"      $B attrs @e6
$B click @c1       # cursor-interactive ref (from -C)
```

**Output format:** indented accessibility tree with @ref IDs, one element per line.
```
  @e1 [heading] "Welcome" [level=1]
  @e2 [textbox] "Email"
  @e3 [button] "Submit"
```

Refs are invalidated on navigation — run `snapshot` again after `goto`.

## CSS Inspector & Style Modification

### Inspect element CSS
```bash
$B inspect .header              # full CSS cascade for selector
$B inspect                      # latest picked element from sidebar
$B inspect --all                # include user-agent stylesheet rules
$B inspect --history            # show modification history
```

### Modify styles live
```bash
$B style .header background-color #1a1a1a   # modify CSS property
$B style --undo                              # revert last change
$B style --undo 2                            # revert specific change
```

### Clean screenshots
```bash
$B cleanup --all                 # remove ads, cookies, sticky, social
$B cleanup --ads --cookies       # selective cleanup
$B prettyscreenshot --cleanup --scroll-to ".pricing" --width 1440 ~/Desktop/hero.png
```

### Inspection
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `attrs <sel|@ref>` | Element attributes as JSON |
| `cdp <Domain.method> [json-params]` | Raw Chrome DevTools Protocol method dispatch. Deny-default: only methods enumerated in `browse/src/cdp-allowlist.ts` (CDP_ALLOWLIST const) are reachable; any other method 403s. Each allowlist entry declares scope (tab vs browser) and output (trusted vs untrusted) — untrusted methods (data-exfil-shaped, e.g. Network.getResponseBody) get UNTRUSTED-envelope wrapped output. To discover allowed methods: read `browse/src/cdp-allowlist.ts`. Example: `$B cdp Page.getLayoutMetrics`. |
| `console [--clear|--errors]` | Console messages (--errors filters to error/warning) |
| `cookies` | All cookies as JSON |
| `css <sel> <prop>` | Computed CSS value |
| `dialog [--clear]` | Dialog messages |
| `eval <file>` | Run JavaScript from a file in the page context and return result as string. Path must resolve under /tmp or cwd (no traversal). Use eval for multi-line scripts; use js for one-liners. |
| `inspect [selector] [--all] [--history]` | Deep CSS inspection via CDP — full rule cascade, box model, computed styles |
| `is <prop> <sel|@ref>` | State check on element. Valid <prop> values: visible, hidden, enabled, disabled, checked, editable, focused (case-sensitive). <sel> accepts a CSS selector OR an @ref token from a prior snapshot (e.g. @e3, @c1) — refs are interchangeable with selectors anywhere a selector is expected. |
| `js <expr>` | Run inline JavaScript expression in the page context and return result as string. Same JS sandbox as eval; the only difference is js takes an inline expr while eval reads from a file. |
| `network [--clear]` | Network requests |
| `perf` | Page load timings |
| `storage  |  storage set <key> <value>` | Read both localStorage and sessionStorage as JSON. With "set <key> <value>", write to localStorage only (sessionStorage is read-only via this command — set it with `js sessionStorage.setItem(...)`). |
| `ux-audit` | Extract page structure for UX behavioral analysis — site ID, nav, headings, text blocks, interactive elements. Returns JSON for agent interpretation. |

### Visual
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `diff <url1> <url2>` | Text diff between pages |
| `pdf [path] [--format letter|a4|legal] [--width <dim> --height <dim>] [--margins <dim>] [--margin-top <dim> --margin-right <dim> --margin-bottom <dim> --margin-left <dim>] [--header-template <html>] [--footer-template <html>] [--page-numbers] [--tagged] [--outline] [--print-background] [--prefer-css-page-size] [--toc] [--tab-id <N>]  |  pdf --from-file <payload.json> [--tab-id <N>]` | Save the current page as PDF. Supports page layout (--format, --width, --height, --margins, --margin-*), structure (--toc waits for Paged.js), branding (--header-template, --footer-template, --page-numbers), accessibility (--tagged, --outline), and --from-file <payload.json> for large payloads. Use --tab-id <N> to target a specific tab. |
| `prettyscreenshot [--scroll-to sel|text] [--cleanup] [--hide sel...] [--width px] [path]` | Clean screenshot with optional cleanup, scroll positioning, and element hiding |
| `responsive [prefix]` | Screenshots at mobile (375x812), tablet (768x1024), desktop (1280x720). Saves as {prefix}-mobile.png etc. |
| `screenshot [--selector <css>] [--viewport] [--clip x,y,w,h] [--base64] [selector|@ref] [path]` | Save screenshot. --selector targets a specific element (explicit flag form). Positional selectors starting with ./#/@/[ still work. |

### Snapshot
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `snapshot [flags]` | Accessibility tree with @e refs for element selection. Flags: -i interactive only, -c compact, -d N depth limit, -s sel scope, -D diff vs previous, -a annotated screenshot, -o path output, -C cursor-interactive @c refs |

### Meta
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `chain  (JSON via stdin)` | Run a sequence of commands from JSON on stdin. One JSON array of arrays, each inner array is [cmd, ...args]. Output is one JSON result per command. Pipe a JSON array (e.g. `[["goto","https://example.com"],["text","h1"]]`) to `$B chain` and it runs the goto then the text command in order. Stops at the first error. |
| `domain-skill save|list|show|edit|promote-to-global|rollback|rm <host?>` | Per-site notes the agent writes for itself. Host is derived from the active tab. Lifecycle: `save` adds a quarantined note → after N=3 successful uses without the prompt-injection classifier flagging it, the note auto-promotes to "active" → `promote-to-global` lifts it to the global tier (machine-wide, all projects). The classifier flag is set automatically by the L4 prompt-injection scan; agents do not set it manually. Use `list` / `show` to inspect, `edit` to revise, `rollback` to demote, `rm` to tombstone. |
| `frame <sel|@ref|--name n|--url pattern|main>` | Switch to iframe context (or main to return) |
| `inbox [--clear]` | List messages from sidebar scout inbox |
| `skill list|show|run|test|rm <name?> [--arg k=v]... [--timeout=Ns]` | Run a browser-skill: deterministic Playwright script that drives the daemon over loopback HTTP. 3-tier lookup (project > global > bundled). Spawned scripts get a per-spawn scoped token (read+write only) — never the daemon root token. |
| `watch [stop]` | Passive observation — periodic snapshots while user browses |

### Tabs
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `closetab [id]` | Close tab |
| `newtab [url] [--json]` | Open new tab. With --json, returns {"tabId":N,"url":...} for programmatic use (make-pdf). |
| `tab <id>` | Switch to tab |
| `tab-each <command> [args...]` | Run a command on every open tab. Returns JSON with per-tab results. |
| `tabs` | List open tabs |

### Server
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `connect` | Launch headed Chromium with Chrome extension |
| `disconnect` | Disconnect headed browser, return to headless mode |
| `focus [@ref]` | Bring headed browser window to foreground (macOS) |
| `handoff [message]` | Open visible Chrome at current page for user takeover |
| `restart` | Restart server |
| `resume` | Re-snapshot after user takeover, return control to AI |
| `state save|load <name>` | Save/load browser state (cookies + URLs) |
| `status` | Health check |
| `stop` | Shutdown server |
